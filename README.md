# Development Notes

1. I used create-react-app, it makes all configurations (webpack/babel/libraries...) automatically, and it is agood option if I need to initialize a React app fast.

2. I put all the colors in theme.css file. I used css variables.

3. All components are under components directory. The directories are nested.
