# Development Notes

1. I deployed the app to Heroku. Live preview: [https://leon-chatbot.herokuapp.com/](https://leon-chatbot.herokuapp.com/).

2. The app can be viewed just by opening it on a desktop computer,
   and by opening mobile view in chrome dev tools.

3. I used create-react-app, it makes all configurations (webpack/babel/libraries...)
   automatically, and it is agood option if I need to initialize a React app fast.

4. I put all the colors in theme.css file. I used css variables.

5. All components are under components directory. The directories are nested.
