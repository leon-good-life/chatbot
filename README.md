# Development Notes

1. I used create-react-app, it makes all configurations (webpack/babel/libraries...) automatically, and it is agood option if I need to initialize a React app fast.

2. I put all the colors in theme.css file. I used css variables.

3. All components (except App component) are under components directory.
